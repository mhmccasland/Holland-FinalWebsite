    <h1><i>Spiritfarer</i>: How to Say Goodbye</h1>
    <br>On this website I want to introduce you to Thunder Lotus's game <i>Spiritfarer</i></br>
    <br>(I will be referring to the main character both by her name Stella and by "you" as the player embodying her).</br>
    <p class="big">

    <br>You play as a wayfarer of spirits named Stella in this space between death and the afterlife.</br> 
    <br>As you explore the world you meet many characters, and take care of them before sending them to the Everdoor (aka, the afterlife).</br>
    <h2>The Gameplay:</h2>
    <br>The main gameplay of this game takes place in the form of completing tasks for the different passengers on the ship. During the duration of their stay, they will ask for various things such as quests you must complete for them to items you must bring them. As you complete their requests, you get to learn about the spirits and their realtionship to you, Stella. It's also sort of a management game as you must make sure the ship is organized what with the different buildings you must build to making sure each passenger is happy with their accomodations. Throughout the game you must make materials, grow plants, cook, fish, etc. in order to complete the different requests the spirits ask of you.</br>

    <h2>The Story:</h2>
    <br>One of the things I adore about this game is that your existence within it is never outwardly expressed. We can only guess how and why Stella is there through context clues and anecdotes from your sister, Lily, who isn't technically a passenger on the boat (from my understanding). This game is excellent for theorizing, as it is never explicitly stated why Stella is there or what you're really doing in this world. Because, if you are ferrying spirits after their deaths, does that mean you too have died?</br>
    <br>I plan to include these elements: the story and my theory of the story, the ending and its significance, and a conclusion.</br>
