  <h1><i>Spiritfarer</i>: How to Say Goodbye</h1>
<br>On this website I want to introduce you to Thunder Lotus's game <i>Spiritfarer</i></br>
<br>You play as a wayfarer of spirits named Stella in this space between death and the afterlife.</br> 
<br>As you meet interesting characters, taking care of their needs and the needs of your ship; eventually you say goodbye, sending them to the Everdoor.</br>

    <h1>The Gameplay:</h1>
<br>The main gameplay of this game happens in the form of ship management and completing requests for the different passengers on the ship. During the duration of their stay, the spirits will ask for various things such as tasks you must complete for them to items you must bring them. As you fulfill their requests, you get to learn about who the spirits are and their relationship to you, Stella. You are given limited space on your ship initially to place buildings and as you play and upgrade your ship, things get easier to organize. Throughout the game you must make materials, grow plants, cook, fish, etc. in order to complete the different requests the spirits ask of you. </br>

    <h1>The Music:</h1>
<br>The audio and music in this game is truly stunning. There is almost always music playing in the background of any given moment in the game. The ambient music that plays is so relaxing and comforting, it gives this sense of peace. There are also songs that play during the various minigames which create a sense of anticipation and anxiety, and once the song ends, relief. The song that plays during the credits after you go through the Everdoor brings me to tears almost every time I listen to it. This song is titled Spiritfarer, it’s the first on the soundtrack and is a really good summary of the sounds and motifs you’ll hear throughout the entire soundtrack. Towards the middle of this song the energy switches from relaxing and deep to excited and anticipatory. Finally it returns to this swelling sense of completion, ending with a feeling of relief.</br>

    <h1>The Story:</h1>
<br>One of the things I adore about this game is that your existence within it is never outwardly expressed. We can only guess how and why Stella is there through context clues and anecdotes from your sister, Lily. This game is excellent for theorizing as it is never explicitly stated why Stella is there or what you're really doing in this world. Because, if you are ferrying spirits after their deaths, does that mean you too have died?</br>
    <h1>Spoilers Ahead:</h1>
<br>From my many playthroughs of the game, I have pieced together a story that I choose to believe. There’s no confirmation of the exact story from the devs, in fact A developer of Spiritfarer even publicly stated in a Reddit post that Thunder Lotus Games “wanted the game to stay vague and let the player interpret it as they wanted.” <sup>(1)</sup></br>
<br>From my understanding: You wake up in this new world with the former Spiritfarer Charon who fills you in on the basics of this world. It is your job to ferry spirits and take care of them until they ask you to bring them to the Everdoor, finally ready to move on after their deaths. The first spirit you meet is Gwen, one of your friends from childhood. As you continue playing, meeting new spirits, and taking them to the Everdoor, you begin to learn Stella’s story.</br>
<br>As an adult she was a hospice nurse, taking care of people at the end of their lives (fitting huh?). Many of the spirits you meet in this world are patients you took care of during your tenure at the hospital. Eventually you meet your sister Lily and she fills in the rest of your story. Stella had gotten a phone call with some bad news, though we aren’t entirely sure what the news was. She gets very sick and ends up in the hospital. Stella’s sister and mother are in the hospital room with you, and while your mom sleeps, Lily goes through a scrapbook of your life talking about you from her perspective. When she gets to the end of the book she essentially tells you that you’re allowed to go. You’d been holding on for whatever reason, and you’re allowed to let go. So your final action is to go through the Everdoor yourself.</br>
    <h1>The Conclusion:</h1>
<br>I have faced a lot of death in my life. Not as much as some, but more than most at my age. I lost my great-grandmother in 4th grade, both my grandparents on my mother’s side my freshman year of high school, and both my grandparents on my father’s side between my freshman and sophomore year at my first university (Abilene Christian University). Every spirit in this game has died for some reason, and you learn slowly what those reasons are throughout your interactions with them.</br>
<br>In particular, the spirit Alice, who takes on the form of a hedgehog in this world, was the first patient to die in your care as a hospice nurse. She had Dementia. My grandmother on my mom’s side had Parkinson’s which is fairly different, but definitely shares similarities. At the end of my Nonnie’s life I watched her stop talking almost entirely and forget motor functions like chewing and swallowing food. In October 2013 I lost my Granddaddy (her husband), and then I lost her in April 2014, when I was 13 years old. It took me a very long time to heal from this loss. I then lost my grandparents on my dad’s side in 2019.</br>
<br>This game was originally released in 2020, with its final update coming out December of 2021. I was closer with my grandparents on my mom’s side, but with the fresh loss of my dad’s parents, it had brought all those feelings back up. Playing this game changed my life. It allowed me to come to terms with my losses, it gave me a sense of closure I didn’t get in real life. I took care of the spirits as a way to make up for not being able to care for my grandparents. It healed a part of me that even therapy couldn’t heal. Getting to take care of these characters and then personally taking them to the Everdoor when they were ready gave me a chance to do what I couldn’t in real life. I got a chance to say goodbye. My Granddaddy was in a coma when he passed away. I said my goodbyes as much as I could but I was 13 and it hurt too much to see him like that. I didn’t get to say goodbyes to my other grandparents.</br>
<br>This game, while being genuinely fun to play in terms of actual gameplay, means so much to me emotionally. If you have ever lost someone, I cannot recommend this game more. It is devastatingly gorgeous.</br>
