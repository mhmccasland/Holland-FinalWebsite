  <h1><p style="line-height: 100px;"><i>Spiritfarer</i>: How to Say Goodbye</p></h1>
<br>On this website I want to introduce you to Thunder Lotus's game <i>Spiritfarer</i></br>
<br>You play as a wayfarer of spirits named Stella in this space between death and the afterlife.</br> 
<br>As you meet interesting characters, taking care of their needs and the needs of your ship; eventually you say goodbye, sending them to the Everdoor.</br>

    <h1>The Gameplay:</h1>
<br>The main gameplay of this game happens in the form of ship management and completing requests for the different passengers on the ship. During the duration of their stay, the spirits will ask for various things such as tasks you must complete for them to items you must bring them. As you fulfill their requests, you get to learn about who the spirits are and their relationship to you, Stella. You are given limited space on your ship initially to place buildings and as you play and upgrade your ship, things get easier to organize. Throughout the game you must make materials, grow plants, cook, fish, etc. in order to complete the different requests the spirits ask of you. </br>

    <h1>The Music:</h1>
<br>The audio and music in this game is truly stunning. There is almost always music playing in the background of any given moment in the game. The ambient music that plays is so relaxing and comforting, it gives this sense of peace. There are also songs that play during the various minigames which create a sense of anticipation and anxiety, and once the song ends, relief. The song that plays during the credits after you go through the Everdoor brings me to tears almost every time I listen to it. This song is titled Spiritfarer, it’s the first on the soundtrack and is a really good summary of the sounds and motifs you’ll hear throughout the entire soundtrack. Towards the middle of this song the energy switches from relaxing and deep to excited and anticipatory. Finally it returns to this swelling sense of completion, ending with a feeling of relief.</br>

    <h1>The Story:</h1>
<br><p style="height:100px;">One of the things I adore about this game is that your existence within it is never outwardly expressed. We can only guess how and why Stella is there through context clues and anecdotes from your sister, Lily. This game is excellent for theorizing as it is never explicitly stated why Stella is there or what you're really doing in this world. Because, if you are ferrying spirits after their deaths, does that mean you too have died?</p></br>
