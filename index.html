<head></head>
<body>
  <br>On this website I want to introduce you to Thunder Lotus's game <i>Spiritfarer</i></br>
  <img src="spiritfarerlogo.jpg" alt="Spiritfarer Logo" width="563" height="1000">
  <br>You play as a wayfarer of spirits in this space between death and the afterlife.</br> 
  <br>As you explore the world you meet many characters, and take care of them before sending them to the Everdoor (aka, the afterlife).</br>
